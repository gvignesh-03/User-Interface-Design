<p >Pronouns make up a small subcategory of nouns. The distinguishing characteristic of pronouns is that they can be substituted for other nouns. For instance, if you’re telling a story about your sister Sarah, the story will begin to sound repetitive if you keep repeating “Sarah” over and over again.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah has always loved fashion. Sarah announced that Sarah wants to go to fashion school.</p>
<p>You could try to mix it up by sometimes referring to Sarah as “my sister,” but then it sounds like you’re referring to two different people.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah has always loved fashion. My sister announced that Sarah wants to go to fashion school.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the pronouns she and her to refer to Sarah.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah has always loved fashion. She announced that she wants to go to fashion school.</p>
