<p>Indefinite pronouns are used when you need to refer to a person or thing that doesn’t need to be specifically identified. Some common indefinite pronouns are one, other, none, some, anybody, everybody, and no one.</p>
<p><span style="color: lightgreen;">Correct</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody was late to work because of the traffic jam. It matters more to some than others. Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.</p>
<P>When indefinite pronouns function as subjects of a sentence or clause, they usually take singular verbs.</P>
