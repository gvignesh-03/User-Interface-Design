<p>Reflexive pronouns end in -self or -selves: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves.</p>
<p>Use a reflexive pronoun when both the subject and object of a verb refer to the same person or thing.</p>
<p><span style="color: lightgreen;">Correct</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry cursed himself for his poor eyesight. They booked themselves a room at the resort. I told myself it was nothing.</p>
<p>Intensive pronouns look the same as reflexive pronouns, but their purpose is different. Intensive pronouns add emphasis.</p>
<p><span style="color: lightgreen;">Correct</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; I built this house myself. Did you yourself see Loretta spill the coffee?</p>
<p>“I built this house” and “I built this house myself” mean almost the same thing. But “myself” emphasizes that I personally built the house—I didn’t hire someone else to do it for me. Likewise, “Did you see Loretta spill the coffee?” and “Did you yourself see Loretta spill the coffee?” have similar meanings. But “yourself” makes it clear that the person asking wants to know whether you actually witnessed the incident or whether you only heard it described by someone else.</p>
<p>Occasionally, people are tempted to use myself where they should use me because it sounds a little fancier. Don’t fall into that trap! If you use a -self form of a pronoun, make sure it matches one of the uses above.</p>
<p><span style="color: tomato;">Incorrect</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please call Sarah or myself if you are going to be late. Loretta, Henry, and myself are pleased to welcome you to the neighborhood.</p>
