<p>There are a few different types of pronouns, and some pronouns belong to more than one category. She and her are known as personal pronouns. The other <b>personal pronouns</b> are I and me, you, he and him, it, we and us, and they and them. If you learned about pronouns in school, these are probably the words your teacher focused on. We’ll get to the other types of pronouns in a moment.</p><br>
<h2>Who vs. Whom—Subject and Object Pronouns</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve talked about relative pronouns, let’s tackle the one that causes the most confusion: who vs. whom. Who is a subject pronoun, like I, he, she, we, and they. Whom is an object pronoun, like me, him, her, us and them. When the pronoun is the object of a verb or preposition, the object form is the one you want. Most people don’t have much trouble with the objective case of personal pronouns because they usually come immediately after the verb or preposition that modifies it.</p>
<p><span style="color:tomato">Incorrect</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; Please mail it <b>to I.</b></p>
<p><span style="color:lightgreen">Correct</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; Please mail it <b>to me</b>.</p>
<p><span style="color:tomato">Incorrect</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; Is this cake for <b>we</b>?</p>
<p><span style="color:lightgreen">Correct</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; Is this cake for <b>us</b>? </p>
<p>Whom is trickier, though, because it usually comes before the verb or preposition that modifies it.</p>
<p><span style="color:lightgreen">Correct</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Whom</b> did you speak<b> to</b> earlier? </p>
<p><span style="color:lightgreen">Correct</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; A man, <b>whom</b> I have never <b>seen</b> before, was asking about you.</p>
<p><span style="color:tomato">Incorrect</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Whom</b> should I say is calling?</p>
<p>One way to test whether you need who or whom is to try substituting a personal pronoun. Find the place where the personal pronoun would normally go and see whether the subject or object form makes more sense.</p>
