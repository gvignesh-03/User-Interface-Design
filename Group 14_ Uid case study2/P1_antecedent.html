<p >Pronouns are versatile. The pronoun it can refer to just about anything: a bike, a tree, a movie, a feeling. That’s why you need an antecedent. An antecedent is a noun or noun phrase that you mention at the beginning of a sentence or story and later replace with a pronoun. In the examples below, the antecedent is highlighted and the pronoun that replaces it is bolded.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; My family drives me nuts, but I love them. The sign was too far away for Henry to read it. Sarah said she is almost finished with the application.</p>
<p>In some cases, the antecedent doesn’t need to be mentioned explicitly, as long as the context is totally clear. It’s usually clear who the pronouns I, me, and you refer to based on who is speaking.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use a pronoun before you mention the antecedent, but try to avoid doing it in long or complex sentences because it can make the sentence hard to follow.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; I love them, but my family drives me nuts.</p>
