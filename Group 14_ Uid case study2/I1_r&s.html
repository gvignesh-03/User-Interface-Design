<p><b>Huygens’ Principle: </b>The three-dimensional transmission ofwaves, including light, may often be predicted by Huygens’ principle,which states that all points on a wavefront serve as pointsources of spherical secondary wavelets. After a time t, the new positionof the wavefront will be that of a surface tangent to thesesecondary wavelets.</p><br>
<hr><p><b>Wavelength and Index of Refraction:</b>The wavelength &#955<sub>n</sub>of light in a medium depends on the index of refraction n of the medium:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#955<sub>n</sub>=&#955/n</p>
<p>in which l is the wavelength in vacuum. Because of this dependency,the phase difference between two waves can change if they passthrough different materials with different indexes of refraction.</p><br>
<hr><p><b>Young’s Experiment</b>In Young’s interference experiment,light passing through a single slit falls on two slits in a screen. Thelight leaving these slits flares out (by diffraction), and interference occurs in the region beyond the screen. A fringe pattern, due to the interference, forms on a viewing screen.</p>
<p>The conditions for maximum and minimum intensity are</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">d sin&#920=m&#955   for m=0,1,2...(forms bright fringes)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">d sin&#920=(m+1/2)&#955  for m=0,1,2...(forms dark fringes)</p><br>
<hr><p><b>Intensity in Two-Slit Interference: </b>In Young’s interference
    experiment, two waves, each with intensity I<sub>o</sub>, yield a resultant wave of intensity I at the viewing screen, with</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I=4I<sub>o</sub>cos<sup>2</sup>&#920/2 &nbsp &nbsp  where &#920=2&#960d/&#955 sin&#920</p>
