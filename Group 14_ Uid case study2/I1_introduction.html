<p>Christian Huygens, who was a contemporary of Isaac Newton, suggested that light travels in waves. Isaac Newton, however, thought that light was compsed of particles that were too small to detect individually. In 1801 a physicist in England, Thomas Young, performed an experiment that showed that light behaves as a wave. He passed a beam of light through two thin, parallel slits. Alternating bright and dark bands appeared on a white screen some distance from the slit. Young reasoned that if light were made of particles as Newton suggested, only two bright bands of light would be projected on the white surface. The bright and dark bands demonstrated that the slits were causing light waves to interfere with each other. Sometimes this interference is constructive, and the light waves add together to create a bright patch. Sometimes the intereference is destructive and results in the light waves cancelling each other out creating dark patches on the screen.
</p>
<P>Dispersion is one such a phenomenon due to the wave nature of light.When white light is passed through a glass prism it splits into its spectrum of colours (in order violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red) and this process of white light splitting into its constituent colours is termed as dispersion.
    The simplest way to explain dispersion is through dispersion in the prism.</P>
    <h4>Refraction Of Light Through Prism</h4>
    <img src="Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif" alt="Refraction Of Light Through Prism" style="width:250px;height:auto;float:right">
    <p>When light travels from one medium to another, the speed of its propagation changes, as a result, it 'bends' or is 'refracted'. Now when light passes through a prism, it is refracted towards the base of the triangle. Refraction Of Light Through Prism is well illustrated in the diagram given above.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The different colours in the spectrum of light have different wavelengths. Therefore, the speed with which they all bend varies depending on this wavelength, where violet bends the most, having the shortest wavelength and red bends the least, having the longest wavelength.</li>
        <li>Because of this, the dispersion of white light into its spectrum of colours takes place when refracted through a prism.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Why does light split into its spectrum of colours in a prism but not in a glass slab?</h5>
    <p>Actually, light does disperse into its spectrum of colours in a glass slab as well. We can see this if we observe it in a particular way. Before we proceed you should know something about refractive indices. They arenâ€™t constant. They vary with the frequency of light and hence the wavelength.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Now, for white light to pass through a glass slab or a glass prism, it is refracted not once, but twice. It first travels from air to glass and then from glass to air. At the first instance of refraction, it slows down and at the second it speeds upright?</li>
        <li>So what happens in a glass slab? All the light rays slow down and speed up at the same rate because both the surfaces are parallel. And hence, to an observer, it would seem as if white light has entered and left the slab. But the case is different in a prism.</li>
        <li>The surfaces aren't parallel to each other and so the light rays emerging out of the prism finally follow the path that is different from each other, giving a dispersed effect.</li>
    </ul>
