    1.Answer:b<br>
    Explanation:Two sources are said to be coherent when the waves emitted from them have the same phase difference.<br><br>
    
    2.Answer: c <br>
    Explanation: The fringes observed in an interference pattern are hyperbolic in shape. When the distance between the slits and the screen is large, they appear almost straight.<br><br>
    
    3.Answer: c <br>
    Explanation: When white light is used instead of monochromatic light, all the seven constituent colors produce their interference pattern. At the center of the screen, all the wavelengths meet in phase and, therefore, a white bright fringe is formed. Then the next fringe will be formed due to violet color as the wavelength is shortest for violet color. This will be followed by indigo, blue till red color.<br><br>
    
    4.Answer: d <br>
    Explanation: The shape of the interference pattern observed depends on the shape of the slits. If the shape of the slits changes, the shape of the fringes changes.<br><br>
    
    5.Answer: a <br>
    Explanation: When the whole apparatus of Young’s Double slit experiment is immersed in water, the only change is the pattern shrinks a bit. The width of the fringes decreases, as an external path difference is present because of the water.<br><br>

    6.Answer:a,c,d<br>
    Explanation: When Both Intensities are same the Max intensity will be 4I and the min intensity will be 0 ,while one intensity becomes half the Max intensity will be less than 4I and Min intensity be greater than zero.<br><br>
    
    7.Answer:a,c <br>
    Explanation: For overlapping of maxima n1λ1D/d=n2λ2D/d ,therfore n1/n2=7/5,14/10...<br>
    For overlapping of minima (2n1-1)λ1D/d=(2n2-1)λ2D/d ,therfore 2n1-1/2n2-1=λ2/λ1 <br><br>

    8.Answer: 1.8 (approximately 2)<br>
    Explanation: 6th dark fringe in vaccum =10th bright fringe distance in liquid 5.5ɯ=10ɯ',ɯ/ɯ'=Refractive index which is equal to 10/5.5=1.8<br><br>

    10.Answer:a <br>
    Explanation: Use I'=4Icos<sup>2</sup>(ɸ/2) and in each case substitute ɸ as per given in the question.<br><br>
