<p>Possessive pronouns come in two flavors: limiting and absolute. My, your, its, his, her, our, their and whose are used to show that something belongs to an antecedent.</p>
<p>Example &nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah is working on <b>her</b> application. Just put me back on <b>my</b> bike. The students practiced <b>their</b> presentation after school.</p>
<p>The absolute possessive pronouns are mine, yours, his, hers, ours, and theirs. The absolute forms can be substituted for the thing that belongs to the antecedent.</p>
<p><span style="color: lightgreen;">Correct</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you finished with your application? Sarah already finished hers. The blue bike is mine. I practiced my speech and the students practiced theirs.</p>
<p>Some possessive pronouns are easy to mix up with similar-looking contractions. Remember, possessive personal pronouns donâ€™t include apostrophes.</p><br>

<h2>Interrogative Pronouns</h2>
<p>Interrogative pronouns are used in questions. The interrogative pronouns are who, what, which, and whose.</p>
<p><span style="color: lightgreen;">Correct</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wants a bag of jelly beans? What is your name? Which movie do you want to watch? Whose jacket is this?</p>
